*Cursors: Pointers to data. Acts as a temporary work area when a SQL statement is executed. It contains information on a selected 
statement and the rows of data accessed by it. This temporary work area is used to store the information retrieved from the database and 
manipulate it if neccessary. It can hold many rows but only process one row at at time. The set of rows the cursor holds is called the 
active set.

*Implicit Cursors: Created by oracle when calling for data from the database. For example when executing a SELECT statement that returns 
more than one row.

*Explicit Cursors: Created by programmers. Must be created executing a SELECT clause that returns more than one row.

*Why use cursors when you can use collections?

  ADVANTAGES: Cursors are great when you want to access a table with millions of rows. This way you won't have memory issues because 
  you will be dealing with one row at a time, much more efficient this way.
  
  DISADVANTAGES: You simply cannot go back in cursors.
