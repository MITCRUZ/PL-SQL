Sequence: An object in oracle that is used to generate a number sequence. This can be useful when you need to create a unique number to
          act as a primary key. Simulates an auto number field.
          
Auto-Number Field: An automatically incremented numeric counter. Can be used to create an identity column which uniquely identifies each 
                   record in a table.
                   
Cache: A collection of items of the same type stored in a hidden or inaccessible place so that future requests for that data can be 
       served faster, which is faster than recomputing a result. The more requests that can be served from a cache, the faster the system
       performs.
       
Cache Hit: When the requested data can be found in a cache.

Cache Miss: When the requested data cannot be found in the cache.
