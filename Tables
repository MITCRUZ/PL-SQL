                                                              Tables
                                                              
                                                          Creating tables in PL/SQL:
                                                          
Create table my_table (
	First_name varchar2(55),
	Last_name varchar2(55),
	email varchar2(115) default 'company@xmail.com'
	);
(cannot have pls_integer or serial as type for an attribute/column)

Create table my_table_2 as select * from hr.employees; 
(The above query grabs all data and table structure from the employees table and inserts it into our new table.)
Create table my_table_3 as select * from hr.employees where 1 = 2;
(The above query grabs the table structure and sets it to our new table without the data.)

                                                   Inserting values into the table:
Insert into my_table values (‘stan’, ‘marsh’);

                                                    Updating values in our table:
                                                    
Update my_table set first_name = ‘kenny’ where employee_id = 104;
Update my_table set row = emps where employee_id = 105;

                                                    Deleting values from our table:
Delete from my_table
(deletes everything from our table)
Delete from my_table where employee_id = 104;
(deletes only a specific row)

						      Adding columns to a table:

alter table my_table add department_id number not null;

                                                          Removing a table:
                                                          
Drop table my_table;
