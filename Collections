                                                         Records
                                                        
                                               Two ways to declare variables:
    emps hr.employees%rowtype;
    type r_emps is record (
        first_name varchar2(55),
        last_name varchar2(55)
        );
    emps_2 r_emps;

                                               To insert values into the record:
                                               
select * into emps from hr.employees where employee_id = 101;
select first_name, last_name into emps_2 from hr.employees where employee_id = 102;

                                               To update the values in the record:
emps.first_name := ‘stan’;

*if you have a record inside a record, it will need its own select clause if you want to insert values into it.
*Records don’t have any attributes like collections do.
